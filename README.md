# Digit Classification with KNN and Naive Bayes

## Project 1 for W207 (Machine Learning)

This is a classification, machine learning course project that uses the MNIST digit dataset. 

The main deliverable is the jupyter notebook, however a python file is also included in this repository if you wish to only view the code.

### Python Packages Used:
* NumPy
* MatPlotLib
* SkLearn

### Concepts Explored:
* Image recognition
* Classification
* Linear Regression
* K-nearest neighbors
* Naive Bayes
* Paramter optimization
* Generative models
